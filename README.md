This is just to get started, most of the code is just to get familiar with the problem, and I am in no sense attached to it. That being said, I think the sensors and components should be handled as objects in some form.

The references folder has the initial submission documents and one of the references in there, I want to see if I can track down all of them and get them in there. Also want to have the schematics and diagrams in there.

Adafruit is a library for interacting with Beaglebone, it's README has installation instructions. I have mine installed on a VM in Ubuntu because OS X isn't supported. Let me know if any of you have a better one in mind.
