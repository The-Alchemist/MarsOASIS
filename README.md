# High level issues

Sensors (prioritized over actuators):

	[] Test all sensors for output
	[] Make sure output is sensible (calibration)
	
Actuators:

	[] Test all actuators for feedback (Zach and I have done much of this, some uncertainty as to whether it is all of them. Need to consult Noah.)

AI:

	[] Set up auto-operate by having the actuators triggered at the appropriate HSST values. 
	[] Set up the networking required to dump the sensor data and to operate in standby mode.

Database:

	[] Write all the tables.

Website:

	[] Set Bootstrap template.
