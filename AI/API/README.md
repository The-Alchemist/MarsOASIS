# Log for sensors

General issues:

	Output discriminates by data comm type but not by sensor.

Specific issues:

	Assume all unmentioned components are broken.

	EC1	       gives an I/O error. details in EC1.txt
	EC2            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	flow_meter_1   produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	flow_meter_2   produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	pH1            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	DO             produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	LL1            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	LL2            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)

	LL4            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	LL5            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	LL6            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	temp1          produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	temp2          produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	temp3          produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	temp4          produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	temp5          is missing
	pH2            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	MO1            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	MO2            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	MO3            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	MO4            produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	O2             produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	PAR1           produces output. (not known if it is sensible)
	Camera takes images but produces warnings. (Potential resolution: update OpenCV)
