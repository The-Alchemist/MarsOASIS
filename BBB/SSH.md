# SSH Settings

We want our beaglebone to be secure. At the time of writing this we don't have much knowledge so only assumptions are made of the previous users' settings. Since our BBB is hosted on our school's network we want to make sure it's not vulnerable.

My current objectives are as follows (this will be updated in the next couple weeks):


* [ ] Create user accounts for developers (maybe one for all or one for everyone)
* [ ] Grant sudo permissions for only CERTAIN things, (let's not screw anything up yet)
* [ ] Disable SSHing as root (This is a common security practice)
* [ ] Enforce SSH Keys (Optional)
* [ ] Update any libraries we will need
* [ ] General maintenance
