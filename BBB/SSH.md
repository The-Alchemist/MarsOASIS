# SSH Settings

We want our BBB to be secure. I have taken the following steps:


* [X] Create user accounts for developers
* [X] Grant sudo permissions for only CERTAIN things. Developers don't need root (Usually).
* [ ] Disable SSH as root 
* [ ] Enforce SSH Keys (Optional)
* [ ] Update any libraries we will need
* [ ] General maintenance
