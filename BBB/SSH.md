We want our BBB to be secure. I have taken the following steps:

* [ ] Begin assembling useful bash tools for diagnostics on the device files.
* [X] Create user accounts for developers. 
* [X] Create user for general Oasis team.
* [X] Grant sudo permissions for only CERTAIN things. Developers don't need root (Usually).
* [X] Disable SSH as root 
* [ ] Enforce SSH Keys (Optional)
* [ ] Update any libraries we will need
* [ ] General maintenance
