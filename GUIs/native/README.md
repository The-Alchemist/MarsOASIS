#### Description:
We are building a hybrid mobile app (iOS & Android) that will act as a control system for an autonomous greenhouse. It will display all necessary data from the greenhouse to the user graphically in addition to a control surface while also providing alerts about its state.

#### Vision statement:
(what you would tell potential customers) Be sure to follow the guidelines from lecture!

#### Motivation:
for working on this particular project (Why would you develop this?)

#### Challenges & Risks:
- Integrating front-end and back-end on the
- Embarking on learning the ways of AngularJS
- No prior experience working with the people on the team
- Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk ??

#### List of requirements for the project
| User          | Functional    | Non-Functional  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---------------:|
| 01 - [S] As a user, I can log into the app.      | 10 - [L] Display dependent data using graphs.  | 30 - [L] Data transfer between database and front-end must be low-latency. |
| 02 - [L] As a user, I am able to view the dashboard and relevant data such as CO2 levels, temperature, humidity, etc.      | 11 - [M] Display sliders and buttons for control parameters.       |   31 - [S] Latency between control surface and sensors/actuators must be low (almost imperceptible). |
| 03 - [L] As a user, I am able to send commands control the systems in the greenhouse.  |     |    |

#### Time estimate to complete
- [S] -> 1 - 2 hours
- [M] -> 3 - 5 hours
- [L] -> 6 - 8 hours

#### Methodology:
We will be using Agile Methodology for our project. Our sprints will consist of 1 week worth of tasks and we will have a weekly meeting to check-in and update each others on our progress.
